# Contact Sync #

Bi-directional contact synchronisation for Google accounts. 

## Usage ##

Visit [https://contact-sync-prod.appspot.com/](https://contact-sync-prod.appspot.com/) and click 
the button. Since this button links to a protected URL you'll first be presented with some radio
buttons and asked to choose which Google account you wish to use to access the app. Make sure you
choose your 3wks account for this.

The second prompt will ask you which Google account contact's you wish to sync. It's important
that you choose _whichever is the default on your phone_. 

### Sharing Your Contacts ###

No contacts are shared with the team by default.

To share a contact with the team simply add the text **3wks** to the notes field of the 
contact. The contact will then be synchronised with the central address book and propagated
out to your teammates from there.

Removing **3wks** from the contact's notes will cause the contact to stop being shared and
will remove it from the central address book and subsequently from your team's address books.

### Sync Frequency ###

Synchronisation occurs every 5 minutes. 

In the event a new contact is is added it will take ~10 mins to propagate as the first sync
adds it to the central address book. The second sync will then distribute it to your team's
accounts.
